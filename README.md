## About Me

I'm a passionate game developer from Poland 🇵🇱, with a strong drive for creating immersive gaming experiences 🎮. Beyond my work in game development, I'm also a dedicated student 🎓, nearing the completion of my IT degree at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, which I'll be finishing next year 📚.

Currently, I'm immersed in a fantastic web-based game project 💻 that uses the Phaser framework, allowing me to combine my interests in web technology and game design to create engaging, interactive content 🎨.

When I'm not coding or studying, I'm out and about, indulging in my other passions: sports ⚽️, climbing 🧗, and mountaineering 🏔️. These activities not only keep me active 💪 but also inspire my creative process ✨, helping me bring fresh ideas to my game development work.
